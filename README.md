# interactive_form
 Techdegree Project 7

For this project I've created all the JavaScript code that customizes an interactive form.
I've added all the appropriate form validation and added up total costs of activities.
I've also added some focus elements to make it clear to the user what section is in focus.
And made certain sections hidden or inaccessible until the appropriate selection is made
